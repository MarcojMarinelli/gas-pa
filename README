# Ingestion to LogicMonitor
Ingestion via JSON string, see format below. 3 methods for ingestion
# 1 - Monitor file
	Set up LM dat sourse to monitor file 
	In Docker compose map /data to a named volume on the host, same host as LM Collector
        In Docker compose sent ENV for file name  (inc Dir.  eg:  lm_file: "/data/aal_flight_mon.json")
# 2 - Commnd line
	Set up LM data source to run a docker commend on the host, same host as LM Collector
        run powershell command: docker container exec -w /app <container_name> python.exe AAL_FlightMon.py -p json 2>&1 > NUL
# 3 - Via Web service
	Set up LM data source to collect via HTML GET
        in Docker compose set web_services to True. Map a port (8666)
	ensure LM Collect has access to the containers network
        set data source to collect JSON string via HTML GET. http://nw_address:8666/json

Run in Docker
# see docker compose file

# Web services
## Start Web services
# in compose 
    #to start set ENV "web_services : True"
    # Set the port. 8666 is the default
    # ensure network access to the container
 Note - simple Web services delivers following content only:
    #  /json   = GET JSON for LM ingestion
    #  /       = Flight summary  (intended for LM Dashboard HTML Widget
    # /dump    = Dump todays Flight data



#Sample JSON format:
{"arrivals": {"scheduled": 64, "landed": 9, "cancelled": 0, "flights_web_display_errors": []}, "departures": {"scheduled": 44, "departed": 2, "cancelled": 0, "flights_web_display_errors": []}}


DataBase.
Based on SQLlite3. 
DB holds data to maintain persistant view of AAL Web page flight status.
DB can be delated.  Script will automatcily recreate if it doesnt exist already.
Keeps max 365 days of data.
DB name speficed in the AAL_FlightMon.cfg file


Requires - Selenium Grid.
grid_url:http://localhost:4444/wd/hub - Default URL. Adjust as needed , either in ENV or in AAL_FlightMon.cfg file

# Helper / Utilities
selGooglTest.py    - simple  script to test that the Selenium Grid is working  (you might need to manuallu edit the URL for the Grid)
gen_flight_error.py - Insert a Flight error into the DB for testing purpose  (LM ingestion and Alert)
dbquickscan.py  - scan the Flights.db database, do a dump of the tables.
